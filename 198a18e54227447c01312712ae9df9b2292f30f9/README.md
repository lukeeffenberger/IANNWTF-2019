### Recordings
The lecture is recorded weekly. These recordings are only available via Stud.IP.

### Homework
You have to pass 8 out of 10-12 homeworks. There are four posssible ratings: **outstanding**, **done**, **not done**, **fail**. All ratings, but **fail**, are a pass!

When you submit your homework you have to rate your homework yourself. Each rating has a different meaning and a different consequence.

**outstanding** - *Your homework runs perfectly and you have put effort into making the code beautiful and readable. Other students would benefit from reading your code.*  
We will check this. If we approve you get +0.05 on your final grade and we will publish the homework such that others can have a look at it.

**done** - *Your homework runs and it does what it's supposed to do.* We will randomly check this.

**not done** - *You did not solve the homework, but you really put in an effort.* In this case we expect you to include a statement explaining your problems and your tried solutions in your homework submission. Additionally there is a ?two weeks? deadline of uploading a second document in which you explain whether the published solutions resolved your problems or what the remaining problems are. We will check this and if we approve that you put in enough effort you will get a pass.

**fail** - *You did not submit anything or you did not finish the homework, but did not put in enough effort for the* **not done** *rating*.

**Cheating** TBA
